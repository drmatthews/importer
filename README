Incident reporting app - for reporting when something goes wrong with a microscope. A user is able to provide an image (which is uploaded to omero) and a description of what went wrong.

This mainly used as a test bed for:

1. Uploading images to OMERO from a web browser.
2. Running the upload in the background using Celery.

Browser uploading is handled by Plupload. Drag and drop not yet implemented.

Styling handled by Bootstrap.
